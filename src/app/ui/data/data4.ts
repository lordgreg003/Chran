      "Daniel described CHRAN as a reputable organisation with remarkable contributions to Nigeria's democratic landscape. This, he added, spreads from advocating for electoral reforms to championing the rights of the marginalised and waging a tireless fight against corruption with unparalleled standard of civic leadership and accountability.",
    description13:
      "According to SREN President, the visit to CHRAN was not just to celebrate CHRAN's achievements but to explore avenues for collaboration, just as SREN recognises the importance of uniting forces in addressing Nigeria's socio-politcal challenges.",
