          Over the years, CHRAN has passionately pursued advocacy initiatives,
          organized public lectures, seminars, and symposia on critical themes,

          These efforts are not only a testament to our dedication to democratic
          values but also a proactive stance in educating and engaging citizens
          in the democratic process.
