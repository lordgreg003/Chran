 CHRAN ( Center for Human Rights and Accountability Network )...
 
is a pro-democracy, human rights, and civil society organisation
dedicated to strengthening and preserving democracy in Nigeria.
Established with a commitment to justice and accountability, CHRAN has
been at the forefront of the movement for democratic governance,
social justice, and human rights across the country.
 
Over the years, CHRAN has passionately pursued advocacy initiatives,
organised public lectures, seminars, and symposia on critical themes,
all aimed at raising awareness and fostering civic responsibility.
These efforts are not only a testament to our dedication to democratic
values but also a proactive stance in educating and engaging citizens
in the democratic process.

CHRANâ€™s work spans various domains, including electoral reform, human
rights protection, and anti-corruption campaigns. By collaborating
with local and international partners, we seek to uphold democratic
values and empower citizens to actively participate in governance. Our
programs are structured to support transparency, accountability, and
civic engagement, fostering a democratic culture that benefits all
Nigerians.

Through consistent advocacy and community engagement, CHRAN has
contributed significantly to the political and social landscape in
Nigeria. We believe in a future where democratic ideals thrive, where
human rights are protected, and where every voice counts in shaping
the nations future.
