  description5:
    "The Center asserted that its visit to CP Azare became necessary in view of the need for operatives of the State Police Command to ensure a zero human rights infringement while enforcing the directive of the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Kayode Egbetokun, on the Motor Vehicles Third Party Insurance in the State, which commences on 1st February, 2025.",
  description6:

  description7:
    "The CHRAN described the stakeholders meetings as clear demonstrations of the  Commissioner's ingenuity in committing to engage the public, stating that confidence-building between the Police and members of the public through regular stakeholders engagements will facilitate free-flow of information from the public to the Police and engender peace and security in the State.",

  description12:
    "CP Azare likened CHRAN's activities in the State to a mirror that tells things the way they are, and expressed the readiness of the Command under his watch to partner the CHRAN in the task of protecting both lives and property in the State.",
  description13:
    "The Commissioner, who described the Police as a large organisation that may have few bad eggs, pledged his readiness to ensure that the officers and men of the Command are regularly trained on how to go about their duties professionally without infringing the human rights of citizens.",
  description14:
    "On issue of corruption/extortion during the enforcement, CP Azare stated that he has directed all Area Commanders to mobilise their DPOs to turn out for the enforcement and to ensure that human rights violations are not recorded throughout the enforcement. He urged members of the public to report incidents of extortion to the Command by calling the numbers which he had already made available through the Police Public Relations Officer.",
  description15:
    "On the CHRAN's appeal for extension of the February 1 enforcement date,  CP Azare recalled that the enforcement date was shifted for three months by the IGP and that the Force Public Relations Desk commenced sensitisation since then adding that there was no extension that would be enough for an unwilling motorist. ",
  description16:
    "Meanwhile, the CHRAN's Director, Otuekong Franklyn Isong, has set up a 5-man Committee to carry out extensive awareness campaigns to all nooks and crannies of the State to ensure that all vehicle owners are made aware of the need to get their valid Third Party Insurance documents before plying the roads from 1st February, 2025.",
  description17:
    "The CHRAN Committee will also continue to interface with the critical stakeholders in the State to ensure compliance with human rights standards by Police Officers, motorists and members of the public during the enforcement of the laws.",
