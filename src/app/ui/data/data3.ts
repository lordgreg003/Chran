  description14:
    "On issue of corruption/extortion during the enforcement, CP Azare stated that he has directed all Area Commanders to mobilise their DPOs to turn out for the enforcement and to ensure that human rights violations are not recorded throughout the enforcement. He urged members of the public to report incidents of extortion to the Command by calling the numbers which he had already made available through the Police Public Relations Officer.",
  description15:
    "On the CHRAN's appeal for extension of the February 1 enforcement date,  CP Azare recalled that the enforcement date was shifted for three months by the IGP and that the Force Public Relations Desk commenced sensitisation since then adding that there was no extension that would be enough for an unwilling motorist. ",
